# dice_roller
This project is a simple graphical dice roller application built using Python's tkinter library. It simulates rolling two six-sided dice, displaying the results using Unicode dice symbols (⚀ to ⚅).  Each die can be rolled independently using its own button, and the result of the roll is displayed both visually and numerically on the screen.
